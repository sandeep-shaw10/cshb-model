# Literature Survey

In this section, we provide a brief literature review on recent crypto-steganography and blockchain techniques with a focus on secure data encryption, effective steganography methods, and block-chained data integrity.

Data encryption and Steganography are one of the most widely used techniques which are used to protect data from cyber threats and cybercriminals. Moreover, these techniques of data protection have been proposed by many studies to effectively tackle the problems. The main challenge that was encountered was to generate secure and dynamic encryption and embed this data inside the image effectively. Since LSB steganography is one of the most effective ways to easily embed data to create stego-object. However, this technique comes with a drawback as it is very easy to crack by just obtaining all the least significant bits [1].

Moreover, the length of the message may vary, and therefore if the message is small enough then it would be unnecessary to embed it in a large file on the other hand if the encrypted message is very large then it might not be able to fit completely inside the file. Therefore the main challenge that was faced while designing the solution to this problem was to implement a dynamic image object that will be generated automatically based on the encrypted message unlike providing a fixed or static image. However, to implement such a dynamic stego-object, we need to design a specific design format that could fetch the data appropriately. Also, we need to provide a methodology to detect single-bit errors and to provide more variation to the existing LSB steganography algorithm to prevent easy retrieval of data.

Apart from Dynamic Image Steganography, the main aim is to provide an encryption algorithm that is secure and could generate a key to decipher the text message. After going through various cryptography concepts [2]the best alternative was to apply Symmetric Key Encryption. The reason to follow this mode of encryption is that in our text messaging applications any amount of data may be passed. Secondly, since encryption and decryption are end-to-end encrypted end, therefore, the resource utilization of the algorithm should be less. Hence symmetric encryption is the preferred choice as the encryption process is fast, used when a large amount of data is required to transfer, and resource utilization is low as compared to asymmetric key encryption.

Examples of various Symmetric key encryption are:

- Blowfish
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- RC5 (Rivest Cipher 5)
- RC6 (Rivest Cipher 6)

The most commonly used symmetric key algorithms are Blowfish, AES-128, AES192, and AES-256. Symmetric key encryption is the encryption method where we use only one key for encrypting and decrypting the data. Out of various symmetric key encryption, the most reliable is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES algorithm is far superior and more secure as compared to Data Encryption Standard (DES). Moreover, AES is Byte-Oriented and the key length and the number of rounds to decode or encode the cipher text varies depending on the AES variants like 128, 192, or 256.

AES consists of 2 important processes: Key Scheduling and Encryption/Decryption Process. In Key Scheduling, we use operations like Rot Word and Byte Substitution for key expansion and generate several round keys from the given symmetric key. The Encryption process includes Byte Substitution from S-box, Shifts Rows, Mix Columns, and adding a Round Key generated from Key Scheduling. Moreover, the Decryption Process also follows the same process but in reverse order consisting of Inverse Byte Substitution, Inverse Shift Rows, Inverse Mix Column, and adding a Round Key which is the core implementation of AES. Moreover, the current AES algorithm uses a square matrix of order 4 which generates a 128-bit cipher text and cipher key.

As of now, the AES algorithm is unbreakable, however, potential problems exist in AES-128 and AES-256 in recent times, the new process of attacks is combined for boomerang and rectangle attacks. This uses the weaknesses of a few nonlinear transformations in the key schedule algorithm of ciphers and it can break some reduced-round versions of AES which is its disadvantage[3][4]. In order to overcome this problem, 512 bits symmetric key of the algorithm can be used to increase the robustness by keeping the processing time low [5] where we use a square matrix of order 8 to generate the round keys and cipher text which is 512 bits.

After providing data security which is to be delivered from the client to the server, the next responsibility of the text message application is to design an effective data structure that can not only provide easy CRUD operations but also check the integrity of the data whether or not it has been manipulated by adding, removing or updating the database information without user's consent. In order to implement such a feature, the chat data is stored in a hybrid blockchain manner where the hash of the previous message is stored in the current message. It helps in the verification and traceability of multistep transactions needing verification and traceability. It can provide secure transactions, reduce compliance costs, and speed up data transfer processing. After the client API ask for the encrypted chat data, the server will process the blockchain technology by calculating the data integrity of each chat one by one.

The main disadvantage of using blockchain technology is that as the size of the data increases the time complexity to verify every transaction also increases. Therefore in our chat application as the number of user increase, the amount of data also increases linearly so in order to accommodate this blockchain technology, a relational database SQL or NO-SQL database can be utilized where data is stored in a specific format but with the scope to implement a certain functionality of blockchain. Overall the method of storing data is hybrid in nature with the implementation of core blockchain concepts with underlying SQL, Graph-based, or No-SQL database frameworks[6]. Since speed is the factor that limits the use of pure blockchain concepts in these applications it is also an essential feature apart from security. Therefore the emergence of creating a hybrid model to store data is the feasible option that balances both data integrity by blockchain and speed by using the traditional database approach is considered.
