### Todo
- Methodlogy: 
- Problem on AES-128 and AES-256
- Traditional AES Algorithm (4*4 => 128, 192, 256)
- AES-512 Algorithm (8*8 => 512)
- Comparing AES-512 performance with 128, 192 and 256
- Simple and Brief (LSB Steganography)
- Simple and Brief (Store data in database in Hybrid-Block Chain manner)
- Future Scope [next sem]
    - Improving Steganographic Algorithm
    - Testing Steganographic Algorithm
    - Implementing the model as a chat app

### Assumptions / Limitations
- Message can't be edited
- Constant Key Storing plays a cruical role in this model
- LSB Steganography increases the overhead of unused data and decreases the throughput by slowing speed down as the useful data is stored only in the least significant bits. [Improvement: Next Semester]
