# Abstract

The purpose concept of this project work is mainly focused on developing a secure and efficient model for data transfer between client and server that is end-to-end encrypted and promotes data integrity. This model is demonstrated using a simple text messaging application which provides assurance to the user by securing their data. The idea here is to address two major data security threats that usually make any regular chat application vulnerable, the former is the **Man in the Middle Attack** (MITM Attack) and the latter is an incident of **Data Breaching**. 

The Man in the Middle Attack is one of the most common forms of cyber attack the goal of an attack is to steal personal information, such as login credentials, account details, and credit card numbers. In order to tackle this form of cyber vulnerability, we propose to design an algorithm that could easily be used to communicate between the client and server, and even if the data is tapped by any perpetrator it will take billions of years to crack down the information and is safe against any brute force attacks. 

The other principal motive is to store the encrypted messages in the database server so that the admin who is authorized for such a centralized database can never view the text chat between the sender and the receiver. Even in the case of a Data Breach which is a security violation, in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an individual unauthorized to do so or in other terms are unintentional information disclosure, data leak, information leakage, and data spill, the data is still encrypted and the information can't be decoded very easily.

Moreover on the server-side if any unauthorized user made an attempt to modify the data then this activity can easily be identified as the text chat between the sender and receiver is stored in a blockchain manner. Overall, this purpose idea promotes significant improvement over the existing concepts in terms of both security features and data integrity solutions related to the messaging chat application from the perspective of the client and server side.
